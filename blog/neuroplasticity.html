    <h1> What is Neuroplasitcity?</h1>
    <p>We can look at Neuroplasticity as a umbrella term that refers to the brain's ability to change, and adapt both structure and function throughout life and in response to our experience</p>

<p>Taking in each experience creates a connections between the neon part of our brain. sometimes we tend to lose some of those connections because they are rarely used and in return will eventually die out. By practicing the good skills and removing unneeded skills or lack there of in some cases, the brain is able to slowly adapt and change over time.</p>	
<p>You know the say “practice makes perfect” Well that’s how it works. Broadening the skill set with practice, is what gets the brain going.</p>	
<p>In saying that, broadening my coding skill set is definitely key. Creating the habit of coding a few hours a day, till it becomes natural, will be my way of strengthening this skill. On top of all that it’s important to broaden my skill set in general, by forming other habits like 8 hours of sleep a day, eating healthy and doing physical activities a few times a week.</p>
