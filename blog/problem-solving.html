      <h4>what was the problem?</h4>
        <p>The day in a life of a coder.....</p>
        <p>Problems are a very commin thing within evryday life, "you just need to know when to hold'em and know when to fold'em."</p>
        <p> These past few weeks, I have encoutered many error messages testing codes. learning from them and managing to change the erro messagers to other parts of the code, I took as achievements.</p>
        <p>Over the course of time, I am finding methods that will work for me...</p>

        <h4>what problem-solving techniques did you use?</h4>
        <h5>methods:</h5>
        <ul>
        <li>PSEUDOCODE:</li>
        <p>This method uses comments into your code that are like notes, reminding you of what you want the code to do or the end results. comments are for leaving instructions throughout the code for yourself or other programmer, that are also working on the code.
            I use these comments as a check point. Finish one step and on to the next. Before trying to do my code and then having to go back through it.</p>
        <li>TRYING SOMETHING:</li>
        <li>READING ERROR MESSAGES:</li>
        <li>ASKING FOR HELP:</li>
      </ul>
    
        <p>

        </p>
