     <h2>WHAT IS YOUR CAREER GOAL?</h2>
     <p>Given the past few years of covid and things I have been searching for a better caarer path and come across the tech sector.</p>
     <p>Tech and education both come hand in hand, so we will learn new things everyday.</p>
     <p>I lookfoward to the challenge.</p>
   </div>

   <div class="position">
     <h2>MY STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES</h2>
     <p>I am well driven, hard working and I a quick learner. Even though I have these strengths sometimes I can become easily overwhelmed with other things going on around me</p>
     <p>I sometimes find it hard to focus if I am overwhelmed.</p>
   </div>

   <div class="position">
     <h2>WHAT NON-TECH SKILLS DO I WANTT TO DEVELOP?</h2>
     <p>coding is all new to me. I came into Dev really focussed on learning the technical side of the development. 2 weeks of foundations and I am gaining more knowledge then when I started.</p>
     <p>My time management skills definitly need to improve, within the first week of the course I found that time management is really importaint and by falling behind it makes things a little harder with stress and learning to be kind to myself.</p>
     <p>Learning how to prioritise and balance a heavy workload with outside influences will be great...</p>
   </div>

   <div class="position">
     <h2>HOW WILL I MANAGE MY WORKLOAD?</h2>
     <p>creating a routine is going to be my main focus. So I am able to keep upto date with the workload through foundations and bootcamp.</p>
    <p> My routine will hopefully be as followed : Study, work, eat, study a little more and bed then repeat...</p>

   </div>

   <div class="position">
     <h2>WHEN I NEED HELP</h2>
     <p>When facing problems, I tend to reflect and write down where i am stuck, then take a break.</p>
     <p>For myself personally, Just being there as the support team from staff, when I am stuck. Asking for help sometimes I find a little hard because I feel like I ask a lot of questions and when the staff team also has to deal with the other few hundred pears it gets hard. I also expect the facilitation team to be empathetic and understanding when it comes to timeframes and potential outside impacts out of our control.</p>
