 <p> * What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?
  These core learning activities have helped me to understand not to compare myself to others, we are all coming from different walks of life and experiences within this sector. Being Kind to one-self is really important with everyday living, Coding is a very disciplined skill that comes with time. Sleep, making sure you have enough sleep to make it through each day.</p> 
  
  <p>* What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?
  Your values areÂ the things that you believe are important in the way you live and work.
  Compassionate to wards yourself and others helps the morale up lift. Knowing yourself, your habits, your behaviors, and feelings you are able to focus on yourself as well as your surroundings.</p>
  
 <p> * What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
  How important it is to have a balance between the two learns (tech & core)</p>
  
 <p> * What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
  Knowing I had other tasks I could have been doing like the tech side of things.</p>
  
 <p> * Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course? 
  Without knowing the fundamentals of how to depict ones learning, How is one suppose too caring on. Having both tech and core, you are able to further develop	 yourself as a person and also a developer. Managing the pressure of balance is a hard thing to do, through the course I have managed to learn a lot in this short amount of time and look forward to the next few to come!!</p>
  
 <p> * Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Honestly the core side of things has been the easier part of course so far, learning a bit more about myself has been nice. So to answer the question, No it is not a waste of my time.</p>
